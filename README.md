# CECS399
This is a group repository for the CECS399/499 Capstone class. Where we will have a mentor giving us a project to do over the course of the Spring 26 semester.

# Research Question
How does cortical activation associated with attentional control during the triad classification task change across early childhood?

### Andrew Urquhart — Background & Motivation Lead
**Primary Role:** Explaining *why* this problem matters

#### Responsibilities
- Project Background and Motivation  

Clearly explain:
- The real-world problem  
- Why it matters (development, education, neuroscience, clinical relevance)  
- Why existing approaches are insufficient  

#### Sections Owned
- Project Background and Motivation  
- Real-world relevance framing  

#### Content Focus
- Children’s cognitive flexibility  
- Developmental trajectory  
- Why understanding neural mechanisms matters  
- Why a larger age range improves insights  

#### Deliverables
- ~¾ page  
- **No deep methods** — keep it conceptual

### Jay Naidu — Literature Survey Lead
**Primary Role:** Anchoring the project in existing research

#### Responsibilities
- Literature Survey / Related Work  
- Find 3–8 credible sources  
- Organize literature by *themes*, not paper-by-paper summaries  

#### Sections Owned
- Literature Survey  
- Gaps in current research  

#### Suggested Theme Structure (Example)
- Cognitive flexibility and triad classification tasks  
- Neuroimaging in early childhood (fNIRS focus)  
- Developmental changes in attention and executive function  
- Limitations of small sample sizes or narrow age ranges  

#### Deliverables
- ~1–1.25 pages  
- IEEE-formatted citations  
- Short concluding paragraph explaining what’s missing and how the project fills the gap  

*This person should coordinate with William Armentrout to ensure literature aligns with methods.*
